# Housing-Prices-in-Vanouver
A sample survey of housing prices in Vancouver

Rental housing for UBC is highly competitive, be it on or off campus. The rent (monthly in CAD) paid by each UBC student is a very important cost, for which they may have to plan their finances. The main purpose of this study is to obtain an estimate for the average rent paid by UBC students, on and off campus. The study aims to use a simple random sample (SRS) and a stratified sample of the same size in order to obtain data. Furthermore, a second parameter that the researchers want to calculate is the proportion of students paying more than \$1000 in rent. This study is very important to carry out, as it gives an estimate of rent expenditure, which is of importance to students and families on a budget, thereby helping them plan their accommodation. The study provides a general overview of rental market prices for UBC students, which may even be useful for comparing against housing costs for students across other universities in Vancouver (or perhaps BC/other provinces).
